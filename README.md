#Writing simple Lamda
    Lamda expression is block of code that passed around. In other words, a lambda expression is like a method that you can pass as if it were a variable.
    We will be able to access static and instance variable from lamda. We also can be able to access local and method parametdr until it is assigned to a new value.
    Also you will not be able to redeclare local variable inside lamda.
    Lamda works with interface that has only one method.(These are all called functional interface)
    Predicate: With functional interfaces, we might need to create enormous amount of functional interfaces. TO avoid that Java use generic predicates to do same functionality for different methods.
    ArrayList removeIf is the best example for predicate.
